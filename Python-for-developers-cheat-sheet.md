 # Python for developers - Cheat sheet


 
 - Language basics
    - Print (Hello world)
    - Intendention - 4 spaces. No curly brackets here. :(
    - Conditionals
        - if/elif/else
    - Loop / Iteration
        - for
            - for number in <list, set> 
                - range() is your friend
            - for index, value in enumerate(<list, set>)
                - instead of going for range(len(<list,set>))
        - while
        - break / continue
    - Comparison mosty as normal
        - Chained comparison
            - if 3 < x < 5
            - same as: if x > 3 and x < 5
        - Boolean operators
            - and, or, not instead of &&, ||, != (but != is valid. But using "not" is more pythonic)
    - Other
        - Try / catch
        - With
        - Slicing of lists
            - Negative indexing
                - a[-X] can be viewed as a[len(a)-X]
        - Pass - the "null/noop operation".
    - Types in stdlib
        - Dictionary, List, Set (Mutable)
        - Integer, String, Tuple (Immuatable)
        - String formatting.
            - Old and new ways. Use new way! (Needs Python 3.6 and above)
    - Math
        - Most notably difference: ** is power of. Not ^ as others
        - Integer division quirk. 3/4 => 0, 3/4. => 0.75. (Use // - Only Python 3)
    - Comments, only # .. No multiline
    - None == NULL
    - Functions
        - Def keyword
        - Default parameters
    - Objects and classes
        - object
        - dunder init (ctor) `__init__`
        - self is first paramter of all class methods
        - inheritance => subclassing
    - File IO
        - open/close
        - use the with keyword for implicit closing of io :)
    - PEP 8 (Have a read, but we will not go into details here now)
 - Modules
 - Pip / Packages
