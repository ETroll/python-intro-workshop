# Python intro Workshop

A very quick introduction to the Python programming language through doing exercises.

## Prerequisites

 - [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
 - [Docker](https://hub.docker.com/)

## Setting up the environment

Instead of using the time on the workshop to install python on the computer. We will use 
the VSCode Remote Development extension.

You can find the extension by searching after `Remote Development` in the extension tab. 
Or by using the extension id `ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack` directly.

So as long as you have the prerequisites installed, we should be in the batters box and ready to go! Just open the folder in VSCode and click the green button in the lower left hand corner and choose: `Remote-Containers: Reopen folder in container`

More information about development containers / remote containers can be found here: [Developing inside a Container](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers)

## Documentation

There are a plethora of tutorials and articles on how to get started writing Python on the internet. It is highly recommended that you read one or more of those. Remember: [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/python) is your friend! (And collective memory?)

For this workshop I have created a small cheat sheet with previous C# or Java knowledge in mind. Hopefully it can be of some help to get started and at least help you with knowing what to google for.

## Exercises

I am a firm believer in _Learning by Doing_, so this workshop does not have any presentation at all. No slides! It is all about doing small exercises.

//TODO: write exercise texts and solutions

    - IO
    - Slicing (negative step ::-1)
 - Rock Paper Scissors
