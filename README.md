# Python intro Workshop

A very quick introduction to the Python programming language trough doing exercises.

## Prerequisites

 - VS Code
 - Docker

## Setting up the environment

Instead of using the time on the workshop to install python on the computer. We will use 
the VSCode Remote Development extension.

You can find the extension by searching after `Remote Development` in the extension tab. 
Or by using the extension id `ms-vscode-remote.vscode-remote-extensionpack` directly.
